# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

The project is based on reproducing the enumerable methods to their usable states. The functions would have the prefix `#my_` attached to them, eg: the `#each` function would be `#my_each`.

Functions to test :

- `#my_each`
- `#my_each_with_index`
- `#my_select`
- `#my_all?`
- `#my_any?`
- `#my_none?`
- `#my_count`
- `#my_map`
- `#my_inject`
